 - Original gameplay idea was to shoot a ball into a randomly generated basketball net.
 - The actual gameplay was closer to just shooting the ball at the net, instead of letting the ball go through the net.
 - Due to this reason, changed the basketball net asset to a target.

 - Added a title for the game in the main menu.
 - Added credits in the main menu section.
 - Adjusted the font size of the score UI to be more visual.
 - Fixed issue that the ball can be shot even when the game is over, or paused.
